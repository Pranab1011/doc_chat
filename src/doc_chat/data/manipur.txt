On 3 May 2023, ethnic violence erupted in India's north-eastern state of Manipur between the Meitei people, a majority that lives in the Imphal Valley, and the Kuki tribal community from the surrounding hills.[25] As of 29 July, 181 people have been killed in the violence.[26][27] More than 300 wounded,[28][29][30] and approximately 54,488 displaced.[31][23] As of 1 September 2023 the violence continues nearly four months since it began;[32] and it is reported by a delegation that the state has become deeply segregated as all Kuki inhabitants of the valley, including government officials, have moved to Kuki dominated regions.[33]

On 14 April 2023, acting on a writ petition by the Metei Tribe Union that demands the Scheduled Tribe status for the valley-based Meitei community, the Manipur High Court ordered the state government to send a recommendation to the central government,[34] a decision later criticised by the Supreme Court.[35] To protest the Meitei demands for the scheduled tribe status, the All Tribal Students' Union Manipur called for a peaceful protest to be conducted on 3 May. After one of these rallies, clashes broke out between Kuki and Meitei groups near the border between the Churachandpur district and Bishnupur district, followed by house burning.[36][37]

In addition to the ST status, other issues had been festering prior to the violence. For example, the Kuki people in the hill districts saw themselves as being the target of the state government's treatment of indigenous land rights concerns.[38] There have been evictions of Kuki communities as a result of efforts to survey forests, which were ostensibly made to stop the cultivation of Poppy[39][40][41][clarification needed]

The Meitei community has also experienced a rise in insecurity as a result of the flood of refugees from Myanmar following the military coup in 2021, particularly those from the Sagaing region. The identities of various ethnic communities have been weaponized in the ongoing struggle.[42][40][clarification needed]

According to several organisations, there have been accounts of partisan killings by security forces, as well as allegations of the police siding with the Meitei community.[43][44] A panel led by a retired Chief Justice will investigate the violence, while a peace committee will be established under the Governor and security advisor Kuldeep Singh, along with members of civil society. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) will probe six cases related to conspiracy in the violence, ensuring a neutral investigation to uncover the root causes.[45]

Manipur is a state in northeast India, bordering Myanmar to its east and south. It consists of the Imphal Valley, associated with the Manipur kingdom,[46] and the surrounding hills populated by hill tribes. The Imphal Valley constitutes about 10% of the geographical area of the state with 57% of the population,[47] predominantly Meitei, who are majority Hindus, with minorities of Muslims and native Sanamahism followers.[48] The surrounding hills constitute 90% of the geographical area of the state with 43% of the population belonging to 34 tribal groups broadly categorized as Nagas and Kukis.[48] The Nagas dominate the northern districts while the Kukis are predominant in the south. The tribal people have the Scheduled Tribe (ST) status, whereas the Meitei have been accorded Other Backward Class (OBC) status, with some classified as Scheduled Castes (SC) in certain areas.[49]

The hill regions are noted by scholars as forming part of Zomia inhabited by "non-state" peoples. They came to be administered only after the Kuki rebellion of 1917â€“19,[50] by British administrators without the involvement of the Meitei state. After Indian independence, the hill tribes continued to enjoy a protected status. Even though the Manipur Land Revenue and Land Reforms Act, 1960, prohibits transfer of tribal land to non-tribals except by special permission,[51][52] the seventh amendment (2015) is seen as an attempt by the valley dwellers to grab tribal land.[53] The valley-based Meitei dominate the political establishment. Of the 60 Assembly constituencies, 40 are held by the valley and 20 are in the hill districts.[48][54] The tribal population is not prohibited from settling in the valley region.[55][56][25] Kukis state that they do not want to come to the valley but they have to since there are no roads, schools or hospitals in the hills.[57]

Tribal groups have complained that the government spending is unduly concentrated in the Meitei-dominated Imphal Valley.[58]

ST status for Meitei
The Scheduled Tribe Demand Committee of Manipur (STDCM) began demanding the ST status for the Meitei people in 2012.[59] The STDCM claims the status will restore the harmonious relationship between the valley and the hills peoples before the Manipur's merger with India in 1949.[60] On the other hand, the hills people view this demand as an attempt to reduce the effectiveness of the Naga and Kuki demands, and enable the Meitei to make inroads into the hill regions.[61]

Political background
Okram Ibobi Singh of the Indian National Congress (INC) had been in power for three terms from 2002. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power in 2017 for the first time under the leadership of N. Biren Singh who managed to out-maneuver the INC, the single largest party, and formed a minority government. In the 2022 Manipur Legislative Assembly election, Singh led the BJP to a clear majority increasing the seat tally from 21 (2017) to 32 (2022) in an Assembly of 60 and continued as the Chief Minister.[62] The rise of BJP power in Manipur has empowered the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) to incite the Vaishnavite Meitei to assert Hindutva politics against religious minorities.[63] This included giving rise to Meitei-based organisations[64] and increased vigilantism, cultural policing, and anti-minority rhetoric.[65]
